# Satellite-orbital-path

A satellite of mass m moves in the gravitational field of a space station of mass 2 m.The space station maintains a fixed position at the origin.The satellite approaches from the negative x direction along the line y = R, where R is constant, and its velocity is v0 when it is very far from the space station.Assume the magnitude of the gravitational attraction between the satellite and the space station is given by F = k/r^2, where k = 2 m (v0^2) R

     a.Write a Mathematica program to draw the orbital path of the satellite, by solving the
     differential equations of the satellite' s motion using Euler' s method.Take m = 1, R = 1, and v0 = 1.
     
     b.From your program, find the distance rmin of closest approach to the space station, and
     also find the limiting direction of the outgoing satellite, expressed as an angle measured
     counterclockwise from the positive x - axis.
     
     c.Compare your approximate answer for rmin in part (b) to the answer you find from an
     exact calculation, starting with the energy conservation equation E = 1/2 m (rdot^2) + Ueff (r)
     and solving for r at the turning point (when rdot = 0)
